      their gluten free flavour packets and promote them via a blog and sharing
      their recipes.

        I worked with Pho in early 2024 to get all of their branches listed in
        my Eating Out guide, previously, I kept the main Eating Out guide for
        listing independent eateries, and nationwide chains listed on their own
        page, this was a major change to begin listing branches of chain
        restaurants, and given the scale of some chain restaurants a lot of
        work, but Pho kindly sent me a list of all of their branches which made
        the task a lot easier and made it easy for those accessing the Eating
        Out guide to find more places to eat.

        Following the success of working with Pho to get their branches into the
        Eating Out guide, I reached out to the Lounge Group to see if they could
        provide a list of their 200+ Lounge branches, and their Cosy Club
        branches to add to the Eating Out guide, both of which were regularly
        sent through as place recommendations, but always remained on the
        Nationwide page. The Lounge Group kindly sent me a massive list of all
        of their branches to add to the Eating Out guide.
