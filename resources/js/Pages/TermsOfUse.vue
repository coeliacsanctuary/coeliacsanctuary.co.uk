              Where to eat venues are added as and when they are found or
              recommended to us, if you are a business and wish to have your
              venue added to the list, please contact us. Likewise, if you wish
              your venue to be removed from the list. If you know of any place
              which offers gluten free or believe one of our listings is wrong
              please
              <a href="/wheretoeat/place-request">contact us</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              When we get a recommendation of place to add we do a quick basic
              check which involves checking the establishments website, menus,
              social media and reviews to check they offer gluten free and have
              positive reviews from people eating gluten free.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unfortunately we do not have the capability to give a thorough or
              in person check to any place added to our website.
            </li>
            <li>
              Locations may be added or removed from the eating out guide at any
              time.

            <li>
              All ratings on places in our eating out guide are added by website
              visitors or through our app, any star ratings are automatically
              approved, but any ratings that include a small review will go
              through an approval process.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a review is mostly negative or says that a location has closed
              or changed, we reserve the right to not publish that review, and
              even remove that eatery from our database.
